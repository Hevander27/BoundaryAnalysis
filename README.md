# Project 1 - *Aerosol Analysis*

Created by: **Hevander Da Costa**

**Aerosol Analysis** is a package designed in MATLAB for the quantitative analysis of aerosol plums and jets. The package uses search-based and machine learning based algorithms for topographical analysis of plums, jets, or blobs. The various algorithms can be used to idenifity boundary velocity and velocity characteristics within sub clusters; such as in a particle image velocity regime. 



## Included Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Edge detection algorithm with variable threshhold of detection
- [X] Kmeans based image clustering with fluster percentage,
- [X] Plum/Jet metrics: width, length, areas
- [X] Boundary analysis of Aerosol for circumference 
- [X] Dijkstra's, Breath-first, Depth-first, AStar
- [X] Image segmentation and smoothing 

 
The following **future** features may implemented:

- [X] Graphing funcitonality for the percentage of various velocity ranges
- [X] Dynamic tracing of morphing contigous blobs
  - [X] bounding box method
  - [X] Edge detection and continous search algormithm verification for close fit
