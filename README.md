# Project 1 - *Aerosol Analysis*

Created by: **Hevander Da Costa**

**Aerosol Analysis** is a package designed in MATLAB for the quantitative analysis of aerosol plums and jets. The package uses search-based and machine learning based algorithms for topographical analysis of plums, jets, or blobs. The various algorithms can be used to idenifity features such as boundary velocity and velocity characteristics within sub clusters.



## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Edge detection algorithm with variable threshhold of detection
- [X] Kmeans based image clustering with fluster percentage,
- [X] Plum/Jet metrics: width, length, areas
- [X] Boundary analysis of Aerosol for circumference 
- [X] Dijkstra's, Breath-first, Depth-first, AStar
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can launch camera to snap a picture	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      . Add task from user input 
- [X] ADD TASK
